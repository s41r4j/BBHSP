OverTheWire offers a series of wargames designed to teach and practice cybersecurity concepts through interactive challenges. Each game focuses on specific skills, gradually increasing in difficulty. Below is a concise overview of the main games:

### **1. Bandit**
- **Focus**: Basic Linux and command-line skills.
- **Description**: Ideal for beginners, it introduces file handling, SSH, permissions, and basic scripting. Tasks include navigating the file system, using commands like `grep`, `strings`, and working with network utilities[1][2][4].

### **2. Leviathan**
- **Focus**: Binary exploitation and privilege escalation.
- **Description**: Explores file permission misconfigurations and SUID binaries. Players learn debugging tools like `ltrace` and `gdb`[4][6].

### **3. Natas**
- **Focus**: Web security.
- **Description**: Covers vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQL Injection, directory traversal, and session management. Tasks involve analyzing web page source code, cookies, and server-side scripts[4][6].

### **4. Krypton**
- **Focus**: Cryptography.
- **Description**: Teaches encryption concepts through challenges involving classic ciphers (e.g., Caesar, Vigen√®re) and cryptographic analysis[4][6].

### **5. Narnia**
- **Focus**: Basic exploitation.
- **Description**: Provides source code for each level to identify vulnerabilities like buffer overflows[1].

### **6. Behemoth**
- **Focus**: Advanced exploitation techniques.
- **Description**: Includes challenges on buffer overflows, race conditions, and privilege escalation[1].

### **7. Utumno**
- **Focus**: System-level vulnerabilities.
- **Description**: Emphasizes low-level system exploitation[6].

### **8. Maze**
- **Focus**: Complex problem-solving.
- **Description**: Combines multiple skill sets to solve intricate challenges[6].

### **9. Vortex**  
- **Focus**: Low-level programming & binary exploitation  
- **Description**: Challenges involve network protocols, endianness manipulation, and binary analysis. Levels require handling integer overflows (Level 0)[1], crafting buffer overflow payloads (Level 1)[1], and exploiting tar file vulnerabilities (Level 2)[1]. Designed for 32-bit x86 architectures with heavy use of Python/PHP scripting[6][11].  

### **10. Manpage**  
- **Focus**: Linux C programming pitfalls  
- **Description**: Emphasizes meticulous reading of manpages to avoid common code vulnerabilities like improper pointer handling and memory leaks. Levels involve analyzing SUID binaries and debugging compiled code[2][7].  

### **11. Drifter**  
- **Focus**: Advanced system exploitation  
- **Description**: Focuses on kernel-level vulnerabilities and hardware interaction. Challenges may involve writing custom drivers or exploiting race conditions (specific details scarce in available sources).  

### **12. FormulaOne**  
- **Focus**: Reverse engineering & protocol analysis  
- **Description**: Tasks involve analyzing custom network protocols or proprietary binary formats. Likely requires tools like Wireshark and radare2 (exact mechanics unconfirmed in sources).

### **Released Conference Wargames**  
#### **1. HES2010**  
- **Theme**: Corporate espionage at dirty-underwear.com  
- **Skills**: Web exploitation, forensics, and privilege escalation via a VM environment[8][10].  

#### **2. Abraxas**  
- **Theme**: Security audit of dildosfromspace.com  
- **Skills**: Combines web app testing (XSS/SQLi) with binary reverse engineering. Includes custom services mimicking real-world infrastructure[3][8].  

#### **3. Monxla**  
- **Theme**: Cybercrime investigation against the Nasenko family  
- **Skills**: PDF steganography analysis (Base64 decoding)[4], service enumeration via nmap[4], and IRC protocol exploitation[9].  

#### **4. Kishi**  
- **Theme**: Unspecified (archived release)  
- **Skills**: Presumed to focus on memory corruption and kernel exploits based on OTW's pattern (detailed documentation unavailable)[8].
